# 🍑 NEXTSPLASH

Welcome, digital traveller. You clicked the GitHub link.  
You’ve seen the message. You’ve seen the peaches.  
Now you’re here. Congratulations — you’ve found the source code to... whatever _that_ was.

This is **nextsplash**, the high-effort, low-purpose splash page that proudly declares **SEND NUDES** while peach emojis float around like it's an interpretive dance about oversharing.

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – Because this needed routing, SSR, and the full power of React for reasons we won’t question.
- [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) – To breathe chaotic life into the flying 🍑s.
- Sass Modules – For styling with precision and only mild regret.

## 💡 What's It For?

Honestly? Mostly vibes.  
This is the kind of page you build when:

- You know how to deploy to Vercel.
- You want your link-in-bio to raise eyebrows.
- You have access to emoji and zero adult supervision.

Then open your browser and ask yourself what brought you to this point.
