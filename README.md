# 🍑 WELCOME TO THE PEACH ZONE 🍑

You clicked the GitHub link.  
You weren’t _meant_ to. But here you are.

You've survived the **shouting**. You've dodged the **flying peaches**.  
Now you're here, peeking behind the curtain, wondering:

> _What kind of unhinged person built this?_

Well, friend — this is the code behind the page that simply screams **SEND NUDES** while a tropical fruit-based apocalypse unfolds around it.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – Because this needed server-side rendering for… reasons.
- [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) – Because vanilla JS wasn’t dramatic enough for flying 🍑s.
- Sass/CSS Modules – Styled with care and mild regret.

---

## 🍑 What's Actually Happening?

- A full-page message in all caps, emotionally charged and context-free.
- A storm of animated peach emojis, powered by anime.js.
- No links. No buttons. No explanation.
- Just… vibes.

## 🤔 But Why?

Honestly? Not even sure anymore.  
It started as a joke and ended up on the internet.  
Like most terrible ideas.

---

## 🧠 Philosophical Takeaway

If a peach emoji flies across a browser and no one is around to see it,  
**does it still send nudes?**

## 📦 Run It Locally (Why tho?)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/peach-zone.git
cd peach-zone
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and make your therapist earn their money.

**Pro tip**: If you ever feel like life has no structure, just remember this was built with an entire React framework.
